👋 **Hey there! I'm Reza!** 🚀

Welcome to my slice of GitHub! 🌐 As a PhD candidate at HEC Montreal, I specialize in blending deep learning, reinforcement learning, and operations research to tackle a variety of challenges. My focus spans optimal control, investment analysis, pricing, forecasting, and location problems, using analytics to pave the way for smarter, more efficient decisions.

**Off the Clock:**
